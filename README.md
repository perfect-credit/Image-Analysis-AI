## üì¶ Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performance-analysis-system.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd performance-analysis-system

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate

# Set up storage symlink
php artisan storage:link

# Start the development server
php artisan serve
```

## Docker Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system

### Running with Docker

1. Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t laravel-app .
```

2. Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8001:8001 laravel-app
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

### Environment Configuration

Before running the container, make sure to:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Update the `.env` file with your configuration settings

### Development Tips

- To run in development mode with volume mounting (so your changes are reflected immediately):

```bash
docker run -p 8001:8001 -v $(pwd):/var/www/html laravel-app
```

- To access the container's shell:

```bash
docker exec -it [container_id] bash
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission issues:
1. Make sure storage and cache directories are writable
2. If needed, run these commands locally before building:

```bash
chmod -R 755 storage bootstrap/cache
```

## üöÄ Usage Guide

1. Access the application through your web browser
2. Click the upload button or drag-and-drop performance graph images
3. Wait for the processing to complete
4. View the generated performance report
5. Download or export results as needed
